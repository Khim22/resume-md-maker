# resume

My personal resume pipeline. Inspired by many but my favorite is [this one](https://github.com/sdsawtelle/markdown-resume)

This is not a framework for your resume - feel free to use it as you wish - but there are better alternatives than 
this one. Here is a good place to [start](https://github.com/topics/markdown-resume).

## Goals

* Use a single source of truth for my resume i.e. a markdown file.
* Generate a PDF, HTML, plain-text and DOCX version of my resume.
* Automate the process of updating my resume i.e. using github actions to Generate a new version of my resume and 
  create a github release with the new version as assets.
* Have a simple Makefile that setup the environment and run the pipeline - allowing me to easily generate things locally
  if I choose.
