Hi, I’m Tom

I'm a Senior Engineer with 8+ years experience working with and architecting large highly available, cloud-based web applications. I’ve worked in large and small teams and love a good challenge and learning new things. Python is my strongest skill and it is a language I love using for its flexibility and fantastic community.

I live in the Blue Mountains just outside of Sydney, and love my community and where I live. I apart of several community groups (Toolo Katoomba and Blue Mountains Living Lab) that help others to better there computer and technology skills as well as being part of the Blue Mountains Maker club. 

I’ve primarily worked with AWS and Linux systems (Debian, REHL), managing several platforms, services and infrastructure as well as web-development and systems development. Testing and automation are very important aspects in my work flow and pride myself on writing clean, easy to read tools and applications.

Yours Sincerely 
Thomas Crha
